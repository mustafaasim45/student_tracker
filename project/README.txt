Users can use this program to add, view, update, delete, and search for students, with all data being saved on students.csv. The default login credentials are username: admin and password: password123, which can be changed in the code.  If the CSV file doesn’t exist, it will be created automatically. The system prevents duplicate roll numbers, accepts only valid scores (0–100), and automatically saves data after every change.
